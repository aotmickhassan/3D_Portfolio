## üì∏ Key Features

This portfolio is built as a single-page application with distinct, navigable sections:

* **Interactive 3D Hero:** A fully rendered and navigable 3D floating island environment built with React Three Fiber. Users can interact with elements like the biplane and explore the scene.
* **About & Skills Section:** A clean, modern layout that introduces the developer and showcases a comprehensive grid of their technical skills and tools.
* **Project Showcase:** A detailed "My Projects" gallery featuring multiple project cards. Each card provides a description and a live link to the project, highlighting works like an "Amazon Price Tracker," "Full Stack Threads Clone," and "Car Finding App."
* **Animated Contact Form:** A functional "Get in Touch" form that uses **EmailJS** for client-side email dispatch, removing the need for a dedicated backend. This section is enhanced with an interactive 3D fox model that animates based on user input.
* **Responsive Design:** The entire application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and accessible experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
